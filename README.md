# Chat - Frontend Design

Proyect developed using **Tailwind CSS** and **Next.js**.<br/>
This project is frontend only. The app gets six test contacts from https://reqres.in/ API.
I also created a small API in the same project to get the messages of the contacts, the messages are in a JSON file in the samples folder.
<br/><br/>
The implementation is not optimized for mobile devices.
<br/><br/>
Design based on https://dribbble.com/shots/16507884-Chatbot
